Download images from telegram chats

## setup

 - create photos folder somewhere, and edit photo save location accordingly
 - before start, set BOT_TOKEN variable to contain your bot token

## What does it do?

This bot is designed to download images from Telegram conversation. It works in groups and in private conversation with the bot. All images under 20Mb can and will be downloaded. It will save information about the image to remote server using http connection. Bot is authorized to remote server using access token which is generated at the remote server. That remote server is separate application designed to manage photos in their storage location. 

## TODO:

 - save text with the photo
 - save text individually (or not)
